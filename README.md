# Translucent-Skin

A simple app implementing some techniques for real-time approximation to subsurface scattering based on [*GPU Gems, Chapter 16*](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-iii-materials/chapter-16-real-time-approximations-subsurface-scattering).

These techniques can be observed as skin translucency, for example light passing through nose or ear.

## Build

The project ships as a Visual Studio solution with all dependencies already attached and linked. Just launch the project in Visual Studio 2022 and build it.

Naturally, this means it's meant only for Windows.
